## Troubleshooting: Gradle Errors

If you encounter errors from Gradle preventing the app from running:

    - Navigate to **File > Project Structure**.
    - Change the SDK to **Oracle OpenJDK 17**.

3. **Edit the local.properties File:**
    - Locate the `local.properties` file in your project.
    - Update the following line to point to your JDK 17 installation:
      ```
      org.gradle.java.home=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-17
      ```
    - Adjust the path if your JDK 17 is installed in a different location.

After making these changes, the Gradle errors should be resolved, allowing you to run the WinterArk app successfully.
